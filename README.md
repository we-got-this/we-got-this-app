# we-got-this-app
React Native app

## Running the app locally

You will need Node version 12 or later.

```
yarn install -g expo-cli
yarn install
yarn start
```

It's an Expo app. After `yarn start` you can click the button to run the iOS simulator (easy if you have XCode on Mac) or Android simulator, or you can scan the QR code with your phone (you'll need the Expo Client app installed).
